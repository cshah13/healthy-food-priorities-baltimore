## Abstract

## Background

Researchers at The [Johns Hopkins University Center for a Liveable Future (CLF)](https://clf.jhsph.edu/about-us/news/news-2018/report-food-desert-gets-name-change-response-baltimore-community-feedback) found that 23.5% of residents in Baltimore, Maryland reside in a food desert, which is a location that lacks access to health, affordable food options. Additionally, 28.8% of youth in Baltimore City are obese. The overall health status and outcomes related to diets are worse in Baltimore City than the Maryland average—the leading causes of death are cardiovascular disease and diabetes. [The CLF specifically defines food deserts](https://mdfoodsystemmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Atlas_CLF-Food-Swamp_final.pdf) as areas where the closest supermarket is more than ¼ mile away, the median household income is below 185% of the federal poverty level, less than 40% of homes do not have vehicles, and supermarkets have low Healthy Food Availability Index (HFAI) scores. Additionally, food swamps exist within food deserts—food swamps are locations where there is greater accessibility to unhealthy foods compared to healthy foods. [The CLF released a report in 2018](https://clf.jhsph.edu/about-us/news/news-2018/report-food-desert-gets-name-change-response-baltimore-community-feedback) stating the term “food deserts” in Baltimore, Maryland was replaced by Healthy Food Priority Areas to avoid the negative connotations associated with the previous term. Since individuals in Healthy Food Priority Areas throughout Baltimore are experiencing poor health outcomes, the CLF suggests increasing accessibility to healthy food options can contribute to a healthier and equitable food environment. 

[The Baltimore City Health Department has a variety of programs](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/programs/food-access) in place to increase food availability through the Baltimarket program, a set of community-based interventions. Within the program, a Virtual Supermarket Program has been implemented to provide grocery delivery services to low income communities that do not have vehicular access to seek healthy food choices. Furthermore, Baltimore Food Justice Forum provides residents with resources to obtain healthy and affordable foods in their respective neighborhoods. These community based efforts are aimed to implement impactful solutions that mitigate food deserts across Baltimore. The Baltimore City Health Department has [combined resources](https://planning.baltimorecity.gov/baltimore-food-policy-initiative) with the Department of Development Corporation, Department of Planning, and Office of Sustainability to create the Food Policy and Planning Division which oversees the Baltimore Food Policy Initiative. This initiative focuses on empowering communities to increase healthy food availability by incentivizing grocery store owners to increase healthy food availability scores and providing subsidies to households growing fresh produce.

Although there are interventions in place, there is more work that needs to be done to increase food availability throughout Baltimore. If this problem is not addressed, there will continue to be detrimental diet related health effects within the population. This analysis analyzes healthy food availability index scores, median household income, and density of fast food outlets throughout Baltimore to guide the direction of the Baltimore City Health Department programs.
